# JATE-PWA
  
## Description

JATE or Just Another Text Editor is a website that allows the user to enter text. This seems pretty simple; however, it has PWA support, which allows you to install this as a home screen app or as a mobile app. Offline support is integrated into the app/website; data that is entered is automatically saved. The biggest challenge I had creating this application was with the browser Opera GX; to install a PWA from it, requires the user to enable PWAs.
